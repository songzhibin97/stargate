# Stargate Architecture

## Overview

Stargate is a high-performance API gateway built with Go, designed with a clear separation between the control plane and data plane. This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Control Plane / Data Plane Separation

- **Data Plane (stargate-node)**: Handles actual traffic processing, routing, and proxying
- **Control Plane (stargate-controller)**: Manages configuration, provides Admin APIs, and handles GitOps synchronization

### 2. Modular Design

The system is built with clear module boundaries:
- Configuration management
- Request routing
- Load balancing
- Health checking
- Traffic governance (rate limiting, circuit breaking)
- Authentication & authorization
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

## System Components

### Data Plane Components

#### 1. Proxy Server (`/internal/proxy/`)
- HTTP/HTTPS server with graceful shutdown
- Request processing pipeline
- Reverse proxy implementation
- Connection pooling and management

#### 2. Router Engine (`/internal/router/`)
- High-performance route matching
- Support for host, path, and method-based routing
- Dynamic route updates
- Route priority and precedence

#### 3. Load Balancer (`/internal/loadbalancer/`)
- Multiple algorithms: Round Robin, Weighted, IP Hash
- Health-aware load balancing
- Connection pooling per upstream

#### 4. Health Checker (`/internal/health/`)
- Active health checks (HTTP/TCP)
- Passive health checks (failure detection)
- Configurable thresholds and intervals

### Control Plane Components

#### 1. Admin API (`/internal/controller/api/`)
- RESTful API for configuration management
- gRPC API for high-performance operations
- Authentication and authorization

#### 2. Configuration Store (`/internal/store/`)
- Etcd integration for distributed configuration
- Watch-based configuration updates
- Configuration validation and versioning

#### 3. GitOps Synchronizer (`/internal/controller/sync.go`)
- Git repository monitoring
- Automatic configuration synchronization
- Rollback capabilities

## Data Flow

### Request Processing Flow

```
Client Request → Stargate Node → Route Matching → Load Balancing → Upstream Service
                      ↓
                 Middleware Chain
                 (Auth, Rate Limit, etc.)
```

### Configuration Flow

```
Git Repository → Stargate Controller → Configuration Store (etcd) → Stargate Node
                        ↓
                   Admin API
                   (Manual Updates)
```
